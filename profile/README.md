## Yikesable â€“ putting the yikes-factor back in the web

We're a one man freelance web developer company that also runs our own projects + plays around with 3d printing.

Our home on the internet is https://yikesable.dev/ but you mostly see what we do by following our creator [@voxpelli](https://github.com/voxpelli) ðŸ¦„

Here we publish creations related directly to our own projects.
